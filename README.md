# Requirements
- convert length (standard to metric)
- convert volume (standard to metric)

# Scope Creep

- Going beyond the requirements for the project
- Cool if the program had a GUI

# Refactoring

- Make improvements 
    - efficiency
    - DRY - Don't repeat yourself

- Pseudo Code --> Writing code in our own words --> logic of the program

# Functionsm --> DRY
